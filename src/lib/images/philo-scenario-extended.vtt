00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.790
Philo is a prototype system that supports
authoring and sharing dashboard snapshots

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.130
on collaboration platforms.

3
00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.340
This video describes a sales department of
an organization and its regional teams.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.160
There are three main collaboration platform
channels and six characters for this video

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
demo.

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.450
The sales-regional-reps channel is for communication
between the headquarter’s sales department

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.090
and regional teams.

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.200
Chris and Jamie are members of this channel.

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.510
Jamie is a data scientist, and Chris is a
national sales manager.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.480
Jamie reports to Chris.

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.620
The sales-us-west channel is for the US WEST
regional sales team.

12
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.280
Alice, Brian, and Laura are members of this
channel.

13
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.610
Alice is the sales representative for U.S.
West.

14
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.470
Brian and Laura are regional sales managers,
and they report to Alice.

15
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.550
The sales-us-east channel is for the US EAST
regional sales team.

16
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.059
Paul, the sales representative for U.S. East,
is a member of this channel.

17
00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.280
Alice and Paul, as regional representatives,
subscribe to the sales-regional-reps channel.

18
00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.590
This story starts from the collaboration platform
of this organization.

19
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.199
Let’s look at the chat between Chris and
Jamie in the sales-regional-reps channel.

20
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.530
After exploring the national sales dashboard,
Chris wants to share the last month’s sales

21
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.850
data with regional representatives.

22
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.409
So, he pings Jamie.

23
00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:20.209
Jamie, the data scientist, gets this message
and responds to Chris.

24
00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.299
Chris informs Jamie about the monthly sales
goal.

25
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.630
Now, let’s look at Jamie’s dashboard application.

26
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.159
This dashboard application is meant to emulate
Tableau Desktop, CRMA, etc.

27
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.950
This dashboard contains data for the sales
and profit for Jamie’s organization.

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.689
On the top row, there are seven KPI measures.

29
00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.189
On the middle row, there are a U.S. map for
profit ratio

30
00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.880
and a table for sales and profit by region.

31
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.789
On the bottom row, there are monthly data
by segment and category.

32
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.619
Jamie wants to include the sales measure in
the snapshot,

33
00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.039
so she clicks the snapshot button from the
relevant cell.

34
00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.899
This opens a component authoring interface.

35
00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.829
Jamie first sets the time frame of this snapshot
component.

36
00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.979
Then, she sets the time range or interval
as 1 month and the start date as March 1st,

37
00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:07.979
2022.

38
00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.799
As this component will be shared with the
regional representatives, Jamie wants to add

39
00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.950
a breakdown for the regions.

40
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.590
Because Chris told her about the sales goal,
she chooses a template that can include it.

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.500
This template also generates a short text
message for the data.

42
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.209
This template allows Jamie to enter the goal
value and the name of the goal.

43
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.150
In the same way, Jamie creates a snapshot
component for the Profit measure for March

44
00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.299
2022, with the region breakdown using a simple
bar template.

45
00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.359
Jamie wants to include a map in the snapshot,
so she clicks the snapshot button for the

46
00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.359
map.

47
00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.900
Jamie sets the same timeframe.

48
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.450
In this case, the breakdown for States has
been already loaded.

49
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.840
Jamie finds out that there are missing data
points in some states.

50
00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.120
Thus, she adds a caption and annotation for
those parts to call out an action to those

51
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.700
responsible.

52
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.110
Jamie remembered that people often ask her
for per-category views,

53
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:12.359
So, Jamie adds an interactive filter by product
category to save her time.

54
00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.189
Going back to the dashboard application,

55
00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.930
Jamie sees her snapshot components are listed
in the snapshot panel.

56
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.739
To compose the components Jamie has created,
she clicks the “compose and export” button

57
00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.769
in the snapshot panel.

58
00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:31.139
This opens the snapshot composing and exporting
interface.

59
00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.480
Jamie chooses a carousel layout to avoid a
lengthy post

60
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.599
Then, Jamie sets a channel to export the snapshot,
and she allows others to share the snapshot

61
00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.220
in different channels so that the sales representatives
can share with their teammates.

62
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.579
Jamie also sets the freshness of her snapshot.

63
00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:52.870
To do so, she infers the freshness from the
components, and sets the exact date based

64
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:53.870
on that.

65
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.950
She also allows others to retrieve an updated
version of this snapshot.

66
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.930
As she has found that there are some missing
points, she marks the dataset as incomplete.

67
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.120
Then, Jamie adds a short message along with
the snapshot.

68
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.010
Lastly she clicks the export button, and confirms
it.

69
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.220
Chris, Jamie’s manager, sees the snapshot
in the sales-regional-reps channel.

70
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.639
This collaboration platform is meant to emulate
applications like Slack and Teams.

71
00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.080
Chris quickly browses the snapshot.

72
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.610
Interactive filtering produces private views.

73
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.280
Chris asks Alice to look at the missing points
because they are mostly relevant to Alice’s

74
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.820
region.

75
00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.850
Alice got a push notification from Chris,

76
00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.340
So she goes to the channel.

77
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.750
After browsing the snapshot, Alice replies
to Jamie and Chris, and then shares it to

78
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.160
the sales-us-west channel for her team.

79
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.039
Now, Alice moves to the sales-us-west channel.

80
00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.550
After the shared snapshot, Alice gives a context
for it, and points Brian to those missing

81
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.550
points.

82
00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.699
Brian, who is a sales manager in Alice’s
team,

83
00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.190
gets a notification from Alice

84
00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.300
He responds to Alice about the case.

85
00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.770
Laura is another sales manager in the same
team.

86
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.889
She also discovers the shared snapshot in
her team’s channel.

87
00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.500
She thinks that a snapshot for the U.S.
West region might be useful for her to communicate

88
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.879
with local sales people, so asks Alice about
this.

89
00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.960
Alice also thinks that is a good idea,

90
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.960
So asks Jamie and Chris in the sales-regional-reps
channel.

91
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.699
Chris agrees and suggests Jamie automate the
snapshot to save her time because it is only

92
00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:28.920
for monitoring.

93
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.340
Jamie thinks the automation could be useful.

94
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.160
So she opens her dashboard.

95
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.900
And filters the West region by directly selecting
it in her dashboard.

96
00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:44.039
Using the component authoring interface,
Jamie quickly creates components for the sales

97
00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:45.800
measure,

98
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.320
Profit measure,

99
00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.960
And profit ratio measure for March 2022.

100
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.349
Now, Jamie thinks it could be useful for the
West region team to monitor weekly sales values.

101
00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.099
Once she gives a time frame, Jamie chooses
a template for temporal data.

102
00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:05.940
The template optionally allows a threshold
range, so Jamie thinks it would be nice to

103
00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.860
include an InterQuartile range as a reference,
which Jamie can change if there’s feedback.

104
00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.979
Given these components, Jamie opens the snapshot
composing and exporting interface.

105
00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.060
For this snapshot, Jamie thinks a mini-dashboard
layout would be useful so that sales managers

106
00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.180
can see the data at once.

107
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.199
As discussed with Chris, Jamie sets this snapshot
to be automatically recurred every month,

108
00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.220
at 10 am.

109
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.460
Just in case, Jamie sets until when this automation
takes place.

110
00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:38.780
Then similarly sets the freshness, and exports
it.

111
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.650
Alice gets notification for this snapshot
in the sales-regional-reps channel.

112
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.759
After checking the snapshot, Alice says thanks
to Jamie, and shares it with her team.

113
00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:50.729
About a month later, the snapshots are no
longer fresh.

114
00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.470
As the owner of the snapshot, Jamie checks
whether the automated update for the snapshot

115
00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:01.139
is okay, just in case, and confirms the sanity
of it.

116
00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:05.990
Chris is also curious about the new data,
so he goes to the sales-regional-reps channel.

117
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.400
Chris discovers the overall sales snapshot
is indicated no longer fresh, so he retrieves

118
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:15.250
a new one.

119
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:24.039
Jamie, as the owner of the snapshots, checks
My Snapshot Home to see how much her snapshots

120
00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:25.530
get spread.

121
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.710
She checks who has seen the snapshot, and
finds Paul, the East region representative,

122
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.189
has not seen the snapshot yet.

123
00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:34.949
So, Jamie goes to the sales-regional-reps
channel,

124
00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:37.360
And pings Paul to see the snapshot.

125
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:41.130
Once getting the notification, Paul goes to
the sales-regional-reps channel using his

126
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.520
mobile device

127
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:46.469
Paul then checks the snapshot and confirms
it to Jamie.

128
00:07:46.469 --> 00:07:47.919
This is the end of the story.

129
00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:52.000
To summarize, Philo supports creating dashboard
snapshots, sharing them on a collaboration

130
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.909
platform, and finding telemetry information.
