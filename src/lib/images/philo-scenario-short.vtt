00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.790
Philo is a prototype system that supports
authoring and sharing dashboard snapshots

2
00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.540
on collaboration platforms.

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.340
This video describes a sales department of
an organization and its regional teams.

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.160
There are three main collaboration platform
channels and six characters for this video

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.160
demo.

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.450
The sales-regional-reps channel is for communication
between the headquarter’s sales department

7
00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.090
and regional teams.

8
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.190
Chris and Jamie are members of this channel.

9
00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.510
Jamie is a data scientist, and Chris is a
national sales manager.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.340
Jamie reports to Chris.

11
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.630
The sales-us-west channel is for the US WEST
regional sales team.

12
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.260
Alice, Brian, and Laura are members of this
channel.

13
00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.670
Alice is the sales representative for U.S.
West.

14
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.090
Brian and Laura are regional sales managers,
and they report to Alice.

15
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.550
The sales-us-east channel is for the US EAST
regional sales team.

16
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.660
Paul, the sales representative for U.S. East,
is a member of this channel.

17
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.270
Alice and Paul, as regional representatives,
subscribe to the sales-regional-reps channel.

18
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.590
This story starts from the collaboration platform
of this organization.

19
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.190
Let’s look at the chat between Chris and
Jamie in the sales-regional-reps channel.

20
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.439
After exploring the national sales dashboard,
Chris wants to share the last month’s sales

21
00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:10.829
data with regional representatives.

22
00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:12.700
So, he pings Jamie.

23
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.209
Jamie, the data scientist, gets this message
and responds to Chris.

24
00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:23.299
Chris informs Jamie about the monthly sales
goal.

25
00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.630
Now, let’s look at Jamie’s dashboard application.

26
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.159
This dashboard application is meant to emulate
Tableau Desktop, CRMA, etc.

27
00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.950
This dashboard contains data for the sales
and profit for Jamie’s organization.

28
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.389
On the top row, there are seven KPI measures.

29
00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.179
On the middle row, there are a U.S. map for
profit ratio

30
00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.859
and a table for sales and profit by region.

31
00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:49.789
On the bottom row, there are monthly data
by segment and category.

32
00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.560
Jamie wants to include the sales measure in
the snapshot,

33
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.429
so she clicks the snapshot button from the
relevant cell.

34
00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.889
This opens a component authoring interface.

35
00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.989
Jamie first sets the time frame of this snapshot
component.

36
00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:07.319
Then, she sets the time range or interval
as 1 month and the start date as March 1st,

37
00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:08.319
2022.

38
00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.190
As this component will be shared with the
regional representatives, Jamie wants to add

39
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.659
a breakdown for the regions.

40
00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.590
Because Chris told her about the sales goal,
she chooses a template that can include it.

41
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.489
This template also generates a short text
message for the data.

42
00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.209
This template allows Jamie to enter the goal
value and the name of the goal.

43
00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.180
In the same way, Jamie creates a snapshot
component for the Profit measure for March

44
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.299
2022, with the region breakdown using a simple
bar template.

45
00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.599
Jamie wants to include a map in the snapshot,
so she clicks the snapshot button for the

46
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:45.599
map.

47
00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.900
Jamie sets the same timeframe.

48
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.489
In this case, the breakdown for States has
been already loaded.

49
00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.739
Jamie finds out that there are missing data
points in some states.

50
00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.120
Thus, she adds a caption and annotation for
those parts to call out an action to those

51
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.690
responsible.

52
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.340
Jamie remembered that people often ask her
for per-category views,

53
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.360
So, Jamie adds an interactive filter by product
category to save her time.

54
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.200
Going back to the dashboard application,

55
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.930
Jamie sees her snapshot components are listed
in the snapshot panel.

56
00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.920
To compose the components Jamie has created,
she clicks the “compose and export” button

57
00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.769
in the snapshot panel.

58
00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:31.129
This opens the snapshot composing and exporting
interface.

59
00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:34.620
Jamie chooses a carousel layout to avoid a
lengthy post

60
00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:41.520
Then, Jamie sets a channel to export the snapshot,
and she allows others to share the snapshot

61
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.189
in different channels so that the sales representatives
can share with their teammates.

62
00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:48.620
Jamie also sets the freshness of her snapshot.

63
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.569
To do so, she infers the freshness from the
components, and sets the exact date based

64
00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:53.769
on that.

65
00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.950
She also allows others to retrieve an updated
version of this snapshot.

66
00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.360
As she has found that there are some missing
points, she marks the dataset as incomplete.

67
00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.129
Then, Jamie adds a short message along with
the snapshot.

68
00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.090
Lastly she clicks the export button, and confirms
it.

69
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:18.220
Chris, Jamie’s manager, sees the snapshot
in the sales-regional-reps channel.

70
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.650
This collaboration platform is meant to emulate
applications like Slack and Teams.

71
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.660
Chris quickly browses the snapshot.

72
00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.740
About a month later, the snapshots are no
longer fresh.

73
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.590
Chris is also curious about the new data,
so he goes to the sales-regional-reps channel.

74
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.000
Chris discovers the overall sales snapshot
is indicated no longer fresh, so he retrieves

75
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.139
a new one.

76
00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:48.000
Jamie, as the owner of the snapshots, checks
My Snapshot Home to see how much her snapshots

77
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.630
get spread.

78
00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.780
She checks who has seen the snapshot, and
finds Paul, the East region representative,

79
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.190
has not seen the snapshot yet.

80
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.069
So, Jamie goes to the sales-regional-reps
channel,

81
00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.880
And pings Paul to see the snapshot.

82
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.230
Once getting the notification, Paul goes to
the sales-regional-reps channel using his

83
00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.230
mobile device.

84
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.550
Paul then checks the snapshot and confirms
it to Jamie.

85
00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:11.800
This is the end of the story.

86
00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.750
To summarize, Philo supports creating dashboard
snapshots, sharing them on a collaboration

87
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.060
platform, and finding telemetry information.
